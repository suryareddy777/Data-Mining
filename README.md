This is a simple python code for web scraping a youtube video using Selenium.

URL is the link of the video you want to scrape

The Chromedriver version=87(always keep your chrome browser version = chromedriver version)

Xpath can be found from the inspection element.(Use Cmd+Shift+C(for mac) on the video webpage and find the 'href' link. Right click on the href to copy Xpath.)
