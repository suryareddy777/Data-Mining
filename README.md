At times you would need data to train your model for better accuarcy and it not always easy to find the data that suits your needs. Creating fake data can be a solution for this problem. The above program creates a random employee data that I used to train a ML model.

#webscrper.py

This is a simple python code for web scraping a youtube video using Selenium.

URL is the link of the video you want to scrape

The Chromedriver version=87(always keep your chrome browser version = chromedriver version)

Xpath can be found from the inspection element(Use Cmd+Shift+C(for mac) on the video webpage and find the 'href' link. Right click on the href to copy Xpath).
